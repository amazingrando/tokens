# YaleSites Tokens

The tokens in this repository are direct exports from Figma. Style Dictionary runs on PRs to automatically generate the platform-specific implementation files. e.g., `tokens.scss` for web projects.

## Releases

Any time something is changed in the `tokens` directory and pushed to the main branch on GitHub, a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/generate-tokens-on-input.yml) is run to build the Style Dictionary assets and cut a new release.

This is an entirely automated process, so however tokens get updated, whether by Figma, or manually, the release process will be run.

## Installation

<details><summary>Prerequisites</summary>

Each environment that needs to pull @yalesites-org packages from GitHub needs to be authenticated using a "Personal Access Token". This only needs to be done once per-environment.

- Go to `https://github.com/settings/tokens/new`
  - In the "Note" field add something like "YaleSites GitHub Packages"
  - Choose an expiration value
  - Check the box for "write:packages" (this will automatically check all of the "repo" boxes as well)
  - Click "Generate token"
- In your terminal initiate the authentication process by typing `npm login --scope=@yalesites-org --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`
- Provide in your credentials
  - Username is your GitHub username (all lower case)
  - Password is the token you just created
  - Email is your public email address
- Done!

### Installing the package

There must be a `.npmrc` file in the project root that tells npm to get `@yalesites-org` packages from GitHub rather than npm.

- Create a `.npmrc` file in your project root (or modify an existing one) and add the following:

```bash
@yalesites-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then you can install the package like any other npm dependency.

```bash
npm install @yalesites-org/tokens
```
